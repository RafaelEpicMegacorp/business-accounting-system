# 🔍 Wise API Integration - Root Cause Analysis

**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Status**: ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
**Investigation Duration**: 3 days

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

After 3 days of debugging, we've identified the exact reason why Wise API SCA authentication has been failing:

**Personal API tokens CANNOT access balance statements for EU/UK-based accounts due to PSD2 regulations**, regardless of whether you use a Personal or Business profile.

---

## 📊 What We Discovered

### Your Wise Setup

You have **3 profiles** under one Wise account:

1. **Profile 74801125** - BUSINESS "Deploy Staff Sp. z o.o." (Limited company)
2. **Profile 74801255** - PERSONAL "Celso Rafael Vieira" (Personal account)
3. **Profile 74839318** - BUSINESS "Celso Rafael Vieira woj..." (Sole trader)

**Current Token Type**: Personal API Token
**Location**: Poland (EU) - Subject to PSD2 regulations
**Attempting**: Balance statement access via API

### Test Results

| Profile Type | Profile ID | Token Type | Balance Statement Access | SCA Result |
|--------------|------------|------------|-------------------------|------------|
| PERSONAL     | 74801255   | Personal   | ❌ BLOCKED              | REJECTED   |
| BUSINESS     | 74801125   | Personal   | ❌ BLOCKED              | REJECTED   |
| BUSINESS     | 74839318   | Personal   | ❌ BLOCKED (not tested, same result expected) | N/A |

## 🚫 The Regulatory Block (PSD2)

From Wise documentation:

> "Please note that if you are based in the EU or UK, you **cannot fund transfers or view balance statements with a personal token** due to PSD2 requirements."

**What this means**:
- Personal API tokens are for personal use only
- They are **NOT** meant for partner/business integrations
- EU/UK-based accounts cannot use personal tokens for:
  - Viewing balance statements ❌
  - Funding transfers ❌

**Why this happens**:
- PSD2 (Second Payment Services Directive) requires stronger authentication
- Personal tokens don't meet the regulatory requirements for business operations
- Wise blocks these endpoints to comply with EU financial regulations

## 🔬 Technical Investigation Summary

### What We Tried (All Failed)

1. ✅ **RSA Key Format Fixes**
   - Changed from SSH format to OpenSSL PEM format
   - Generated X.509 public key format (correct for Wise)
   - Verified key pair matches (modulus comparison)
   - **Result**: Still REJECTED

2. ✅ **Encoding Fixes**
   - Changed from ASCII to UTF-8 for signature generation
   - **Result**: Still REJECTED

3. ✅ **Token Permissions**
   - Upgraded from "Read only" to "Full Access"
   - **Result**: Still REJECTED

4. ✅ **Profile Type Testing**
   - Tested with BUSINESS profile instead of PERSONAL
   - **Result**: Still REJECTED (same token type issue)

### SCA Flow Analysis

```
Request: GET /balance-statements/{id}/statement.json
    ↓
Response: 403 Forbidden
    ├─ x-2fa-approval-result: REJECTED
    └─ x-2fa-approval: {one-time-token}
    ↓
GET /one-time-token/status
    ↓
Response: Challenge required
    ├─ type: "SIGNATURE" ✅ (RSA is correct method!)
    ├─ required: true
    └─ passed: false
    ↓
Sign OTT with RSA private key
    ↓
Retry with X-Signature header
    ↓
Response: 403 Forbidden ❌
    ├─ x-2fa-approval-result: REJECTED
    └─ Challenge still not passed
```

**Conclusion**: The SIGNATURE challenge type IS correct (RSA signing), but Wise rejects it because Personal tokens aren't authorized for this endpoint in EU/UK.

## ✅ Available Solutions

### Option 1: Wise Partner Integration (Recommended for Production)

**What**: Apply for official Wise Partner status with OAuth 2.0 integration

**Pros**:
- ✅ Full API access including balance statements
- ✅ Proper SCA authentication flow
- ✅ Can manage multiple customer accounts
- ✅ Complies with all PSD2 regulations
- ✅ Production-ready and supported

**Cons**:
- ⏱️ Requires application and approval process
- 💰 May have partnership fees or requirements
- 🔧 Requires OAuth implementation (more complex)

**How to Start**:
1. Contact Wise Partnership team: https://wise.com/gb/business/contact
2. Explain your use case (accounting system integration)
3. Apply for Partner API access
4. Receive OAuth credentials (Client ID + Client Secret)
5. Implement OAuth 2.0 authorization flow

**Documentation**: https://docs.wise.com/api-docs/guides/customer-account-partner-kyc

### Option 2: Open Banking API

**What**: Use Wise's Open Banking API (PSD2-compliant alternative)

**Pros**:
- ✅ Designed for EU/UK regulatory compliance
- ✅ Can access account information
- ✅ No partnership required
- ✅ Standardized approach

**Cons**:
- 🔧 Different API structure (requires new implementation)
- ⚠️ May have different feature set
- 📚 Need to research if it supports all required features

**How to Start**:
1. Review Open Banking documentation: https://docs.wise.com/api-docs/guides/open-banking
2. Check if it supports balance statement access
3. Implement Open Banking integration

---

### Option 3: Manual Workaround (Temporary)

**What**: Continue using Wise app/web for transactions, import CSV manually

**Pros**:
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ No API changes needed
- ✅ No approval process

**Cons**:
- ❌ Manual work required
- ❌ Not automated
- ❌ Not scalable
- ❌ Defeats purpose of API integration

**How**:
- Export transactions as CSV from Wise web interface
- Import CSV into accounting system
- Use existing import functionality

---

### Option 4: Relocate Account (Not Recommended)

**What**: Create account outside EU/UK jurisdiction

**Pros**:
- ✅ Personal tokens would work

**Cons**:
- ❌ Defeats compliance purpose
- ❌ May violate regulations
- ❌ Not practical for EU business
- ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED**

## 🎯 Recommended Path Forward

**Immediate Action** (This Week):
1. ✅ Use Manual Workaround (Option 3) to unblock current operations
2. 📝 Apply for Wise Partner Integration (Option 1)

**Short Term** (Next 2-4 Weeks):
1. ⏳ Wait for Partner approval
2. 🔧 Implement OAuth 2.0 flow once approved
3. 🧪 Test with partner credentials

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

1. **The RSA implementation was correct** ✅
   - X.509 public key format
   - UTF-8 encoding
   - Proper signature generation

2. **The token type is the problem** ❌
   - Personal tokens blocked from balance statements in EU

   - No workaround exists with personal tokens

3. **Solution requires different token type** ✅
   - Need Partner OAuth credentials
   - OR Open Banking API approach
   - OR manual CSV import (temporary)
