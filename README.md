## 💾 Database Schema

### entries
Stores all financial transactions (income, expenses, salaries)

```sql
CREATE TABLE entries (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    type VARCHAR(10) CHECK (type IN ('income', 'expense')) NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    detail TEXT,
    base_amount DECIMAL(12, 2) NOT NULL,
    total DECIMAL(12, 2) NOT NULL,
    entry_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'completed' CHECK (status IN ('completed', 'pending')),
    employee_id INTEGER REFERENCES employees(id),
    contract_id INTEGER REFERENCES contracts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### employees
Stores employee information and pay rates

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    pay_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (pay_type IN ('monthly', 'weekly', 'hourly')),
    pay_rate DECIMAL(12, 2) NOT NULL,
    pay_multiplier DECIMAL(5, 2) DEFAULT 1.0,
    start_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    termination_date DATE,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### contracts
Stores recurring income contracts

```sql
CREATE TABLE contracts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    client_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(12, 2) NOT NULL,
    contract_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (contract_type IN ('monthly', 'yearly', 'one-time')),
    payment_day INTEGER CHECK (payment_day BETWEEN 1 AND 31),
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    end_date DATE,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (status IN ('active', 'inactive')),
    last_generated_date DATE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Relationships
- `entries.employee_id` → `employees.id` (FK, nullable)
- `entries.contract_id` → `contracts.id` (FK, nullable, CASCADE on delete)
- An entry can be linked to either an employee (salary) or contract (recurring income)

- Verify backend is running on http://localhost:3001
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify .env file: `cat frontend/.env`

### Database issues
- Check connection: `docker exec -it accounting_db psql -U accounting_user -d accounting_db`
- Verify table exists: `\d entries`
- Re-run migration if needed

See **SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md** for detailed troubleshooting.

## 📝 Development Status & Current Work

### Recent Progress (October 2025)

#### ✅ Multi-Currency & Wise Integration
- **Wise Balance Tracking** - Multi-currency balance display (USD, EUR, PLN) with conversion to USD
- **CSV Import Functionality** - Manual CSV upload for Wise transactions with automatic classification
- **WiseImport Component** - Professional upload modal with validation and error handling
- **Import Statistics** - Real-time feedback on imported/skipped/error counts
- **Duplicate Prevention** - Automatic detection by Wise transaction ID

#### ✅ Employee Management Enhancements
- **Bulk Operations** - Multi-select for delete, terminate, reactivate operations
- **Severance Calculations** - Automatic pay calculation based on days worked
- **Employee Statistics** - Total paid, entry count, last payment tracking
- **Termination Workflow** - Soft delete with optional severance entry creation

#### ✅ Database Optimization
- **Connection Pool Configuration** - Resolved connection exhaustion issues
  - Max connections: 5 (Railway free tier optimized)
  - Idle timeout: 30 seconds
  - Connection timeout: 10 seconds
- **Diagnostic Endpoint** - `GET /api/wise/test-connection` for troubleshooting
- **Enhanced Error Handling** - Detailed logging and user-friendly error messages

### Wise API Integration Challenge

#### Initial Implementation
Implemented full Wise API integration with:
- Real-time transaction sync via Wise API
- Webhook-based balance updates
- SCA (Strong Customer Authentication) flow
- Transaction review and classification queue
- Automated sync scheduling

**Components Built:**
- Backend (8 files): Services, controllers, routes, webhook handlers, SCA signing
- Frontend (1 component): Transaction review UI
- Scripts (5 files): Testing, monitoring, webhook creation

#### Pivot to Manual CSV Import
After encountering persistent challenges with Wise API communication, made strategic decision to:
- **Remove full API integration** - Deleted all Wise API service files
- **Implement CSV upload** - Manual import workflow via exported CSV files
- **Retain classification logic** - Automatic transaction categorization
- **Keep database models** - Transaction tracking and balance management

**CSV Import Workflow:**
1. User exports CSV from Wise.com (Account → Statements → Export CSV)
2. Upload via dashboard modal with drag-and-drop interface
3. Backend parses 21-column Wise CSV format
4. Automatic transaction classification (income/expense)
5. Duplicate prevention by Wise transaction ID
6. Bulk insert with database transaction
7. Balance auto-update after successful import

### Current Blocker: Wise API Communication

#### Technical Challenges Encountered
1. **SCA Authentication Complexity** - Strong Customer Authentication flow integration issues
2. **Webhook Signature Validation** - RSA signature verification challenges
3. **API Communication Errors** - Connection and authorization problems
4. **Real-time Sync Reliability** - Maintaining consistent sync state

#### Issues Resolved During CSV Implementation
- **Database Connection Pool Exhaustion** - Fixed with proper pool configuration
- **Variable Naming Inconsistency** - Standardized database import patterns
- **CSV Format Validation** - 21-column Wise export format verification
- **Error Message Clarity** - Enhanced user feedback and troubleshooting

**Documentation Created:**
- `WISE_API_CHANGES.pdf` - 10-page technical document covering all changes, issues, and solutions
- Comprehensive logging for production debugging
- Diagnostic endpoints for connection testing

### Freelancer Solution Approach

#### Current Strategy
Given the complexity of Wise API integration, a **freelance developer has been hired** to:
1. Implement working Wise API connection
2. Establish reliable real-time transaction sync
3. Handle SCA authentication flow properly
4. Set up webhook infrastructure correctly
5. Deliver fully functional source code

#### Next Steps After Freelancer Delivery
Once the freelancer provides the working solution:

1. **Code Review & Analysis**
   - Examine freelancer's implementation approach
   - Understand authentication flow and API patterns
   - Review webhook handling and signature validation
   - Identify key differences from previous attempt

2. **Integration Planning**
   - Map freelancer's code to existing codebase structure
   - Plan migration from CSV import to API sync
   - Determine backward compatibility requirements
   - Design testing strategy

3. **Implementation**
   - Apply freelancer's solution to this codebase
   - Integrate with existing database models
   - Preserve CSV import as fallback option
   - Update frontend components for real-time sync

4. **Testing & Validation**
   - Test SCA authentication flow end-to-end
   - Verify webhook signature validation
   - Test transaction sync accuracy
   - Monitor connection pool stability
   - Validate multi-currency handling

5. **Documentation & Deployment**
   - Document new API integration approach
   - Update README with API setup instructions
   - Create deployment checklist
   - Add monitoring and alerting

#### Interim Solution
Until Wise API is fully functional:
- ✅ **CSV Import Available** - Users can manually upload Wise transaction exports
- ✅ **Balance Tracking** - Multi-currency balances displayed in dashboard
- ✅ **Transaction Classification** - Automatic categorization working
- ✅ **No Data Loss** - All transactions properly stored and tracked

**Status:** ⏳ **Waiting for freelancer's working Wise API solution**
