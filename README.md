## ðŸ’¾ Database Schema

### entries
Stores all financial transactions (income, expenses, salaries)

```sql
CREATE TABLE entries (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,

    category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    detail TEXT,
    base_amount DECIMAL(12, 2) NOT NULL,
    total DECIMAL(12, 2) NOT NULL,
    entry_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'completed' CHECK (status IN ('completed', 'pending')),
    employee_id INTEGER REFERENCES employees(id),
    contract_id INTEGER REFERENCES contracts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### employees
Stores employee information and pay rates

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    pay_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (pay_type IN ('monthly', 'weekly', 'hourly')),
    pay_rate DECIMAL(12, 2) NOT NULL,

);
```

### Relationships
- `entries.employee_id` â†’ `employees.id` (FK, nullable)

### Frontend can't connect
- Verify backend is running on http://localhost:3001
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify .env file: `cat frontend/.env`

### Database issues
- Check connection: `docker exec -it accounting_db psql -U accounting_user -d accounting_db`
- Verify table exists: `\d entries`
- Re-run migration if needed

See **SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md** for detailed troubleshooting.

## Support

For issues:
